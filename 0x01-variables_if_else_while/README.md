# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
This project aims to enhance your understanding of these concepts and strengthen your programming skills.

## Learning Objectives
- Purpose of `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`
- The `ASCII` chaeacter set
- Understanding the `while` loop
- Using the `if`,`if ... else` statements
- Declarating variables of types `char`,`int`,`unsigned int`

## Project Files
Project files in `0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while` include:
- `0-positive_or_negative.c`; A C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` and determines if it is postive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.c`: A C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` and prints the last digit of that number.
- `2-print_alphabet.c`: A C program that prints the aiphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- `3-prints_alphabets.c`: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- `4-print_alphabt.c`: A C program thatprints the alphabet in lowercase, ecept for the letters 'q' and 'e'.
- `5-print_numbers.c`: A C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10, starting from 0.
- `6-print_numberz.c`: A C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10, starting from 0, using only the `putchar` function.
- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: A C program that prints all the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, followed by a new line.
- `8-print_base16.c`: A C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase, follwed by a new line.
- `9-print_comb.c`: A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, seperated by commas.
- `10-print_comb3.c`: A C program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers, seperated by commas.
- `100-print_comb3.c`: A C program that prints all possible combinations of three-digit numbers, seperated by commas.
- `101-print_com4.c`: A C program that prints all possible combinations of four-digit numbers, seperated by commas.
- `102-print_comb5.c`: A C program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, seperated by commas.
