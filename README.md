This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at Alx Software Engineering Program. Created to help in acquring a strong foundation in low-level programming languages such as C.The specific list of projects contained follows:

- 0x00. C - Hello, World
- 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
- 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
- 0x03. C - Debugging
- 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
- 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
- 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
- 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
- 0x08. C - Recursion
- 0x09. C - Static libraries
- 0x0A. C - Argc, argv
- 0x0B. C - Malloc, free
